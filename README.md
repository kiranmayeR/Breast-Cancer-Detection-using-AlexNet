# Breast Cancer Classification using AlexNet

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements **AlexNet**, a deep convolutional neural network, to classify breast cancer images into **benign** or **malignant** categories using a **Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset**. The goal is to achieve high-accuracy, automated cancer detection to support early diagnosis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Image Classification:** Identifies breast cancer types as benign or malignant from histopathology images.
- **Pretrained AlexNet Architecture:** Leverages a proven CNN model known for deep feature extraction.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances model generalization on limited datasets.
- **Adam Optimizer & Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss:** Ensures stable training and improved convergence.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **OpenCV (for image preprocessing)**
- **Matplotlib (optional for visualization)**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset** (e.g., BreaKHis or IDC dataset)
- Contains labeled images of benign and malignant breast tissue.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The AlexNet architecture consists of:

- **5 Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial and texture features.
- **Max Pooling:** Reduces feature map size.
- **ReLU Activation:** Introduces non-linearity.
- **Dropout:** Prevents overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Learns complex patterns.
- **Softmax Layer:** Outputs benign or malignant classification.

---

## 🔥 Training Process

1. **Preprocess** images — resize, normalize, and augment.
2. **Load AlexNet** architecture with custom input/output layers.
3. **Train the model** using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
4. **Evaluate performance** using accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

## 🎯 Results

- Achieved high classification accuracy with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Extracted deep, discriminative features from histopathology images.
- Improved generalization with data augmentation and dropout layers.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Implement **transfer learning** from other medical image datasets.
- Extend classification to **multi-class tumors** (e.g., invasive vs non-invasive).
- Optimize performance using **Learning Rate Schedulers**.
